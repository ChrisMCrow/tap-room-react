# Tap Room Website

#### A product inventory management website for Tap Room Employees

#### By **Chris Crow**

## Description

A website that allows Tap Room epmployees to manage inventory and pricing. This is based on a project recently built first in angular. I appreciate the differences. I like how React keeps the html, js, and css all essentially in the same file. It keeps it easy when making tweaks. Angular seems more flexible so far however with passing data around.

## Notes
Week 1: 
  A few unforeseen issues for this project included passing props up rather than down. I was attempting have the edit button for each of the items in the list be able to pass the props from that specific item to a new component nested outside of that one, but wasn't able to figure it out.
Week 2:
  I learned how to address all the issues from week one. No real issues this week. Everything functions.
